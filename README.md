# Pima-Indian-Diabetes-SVM-Classifier

This Notebook demonstrates the process of building a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting diabetes using the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. 

The notebook covers the following topics:
* Importing necessary libraries and reading in the dataset
* Data analysis to understand the features of the dataset and their relationship with the target value
* Feature scaling and splitting the dataset into training and test sets
* Training the SVM model using a linear kernel
* Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix
* Creating a predictive system to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on user input.

## Libraries Used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The Pima Indian Diabetes dataset contains 768 observations and 8 features. The target variable is binary (0 or 1), indicating whether or not a patient has diabetes.

## SVM Model
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful class of supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression analysis. In this notebook, we train an SVM model with a linear kernel to predict diabetes in patients based on the features of the dataset.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix. 

## Predictive System
Finally, we create a predictive system that takes in user input and predicts the likelihood of diabetes.
